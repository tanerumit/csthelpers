\title{Calculate simple institution-based weights (per scenario)}
\usage{
compute_gcm_weights_by_institution(
  data,
  scenario_col = "scenario",
  institution_col = "institution",
  model_col = "model",
  weight_col = "w_inst"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame containing at least scenario, model, institution.}

\item{scenario_col}{Character. Scenario/SSP column name. Default "scenario".}

\item{institution_col}{Character. Institution column name. Default "institution".}

\item{model_col}{Character. Model column name. Default "model".}

\item{weight_col}{Character. Output weight column name. Default "w_inst".}
}
\value{
`data` with an added column `weight_col` summing to 1 within each scenario.
}
\description{
Within each scenario (e.g., SSP), assigns equal total weight to each institution,
then splits that institution weight equally among models from that institution
present in that scenario. If multiple rows exist for the same model within a
scenario (e.g., ensemble members), the model's weight is split equally across rows.
