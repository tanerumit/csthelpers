\title{Select a Space-Filling Subset of Points Using Maximin Sampling}
\usage{
select_maximin(x, y, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. First coordinate (e.g., CMDmin).}

\item{y}{Numeric vector. Second coordinate (e.g., DPI).}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of points to select. Must satisfy \code{k <= length(x)}.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of indices specifying the selected subset of points.
}
\description{
Given two numeric vectors \code{x} and \code{y} of equal length, this function:
\enumerate{
  \item Forms a point set \eqn{(x_i, y_i)}.
  \item Computes the full pairwise distance matrix.
  \item Initializes the selection with the point closest to the centroid.
  \item Iteratively adds the point with the largest minimum distance from the
        already-selected set.
}
The result is a set of indices corresponding to the selected points. This
method is commonly used in experimental design, scenario reduction, and
space-filling sampling for climate and hydrological stress-testing.
}
\details{
Implements a greedy maximin (farthest-point) selection algorithm to extract
a subset of \code{k} points from a two-dimensional point cloud. The algorithm
selects points such that each newly added point maximizes the minimum
Euclidean distance to all previously selected points, producing a
well-distributed, space-filling subset across the \code{(x, y)} domain.

\examples{
set.seed(1)
x <- runif(50, 0, 100)
y <- runif(50, 0, 1)
idx <- select_maximin(x, y, k = 10)
plot(x, y, pch = 19)
points(x[idx], y[idx], col = "red", pch = 19, cex = 1.4)
