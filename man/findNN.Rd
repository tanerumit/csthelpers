\title{Find Nearest Neighbor (k = 1) in Euclidean Space}
\usage{
findNN(data, query, return_dist = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric matrix or data frame containing reference points,
with one row per point and one column per coordinate dimension (e.g. x, y, z).}

\item{query}{Numeric matrix or data frame containing query points to match,
with the same number of columns as `data`.}

\item{return_dist}{Logical; if `TRUE`, also returns the Euclidean distance
to the nearest neighbor for each query point. Default is `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
If `return_dist = FALSE`, returns an integer vector of indices indicating the
nearest neighbor in `data` for each query point.  
If `return_dist = TRUE`, returns a list with two elements:
\describe{
  \item{idx}{Integer vector of nearest-neighbor indices.}
  \item{dist}{Numeric vector of Euclidean distances corresponding to each match.}
}
}
\description{
A simple, pure-R implementation of a single nearest-neighbor search
between two numeric coordinate sets.  
For each query point, the function identifies the index (and optionally
the distance) of the closest point in the reference dataset.
}
\details{
This function performs a brute-force nearest-neighbor search by computing
the squared Euclidean distance between each query point and all reference
points.  
It is straightforward and accurate, but scales as O(n_query × n_data), so it
may be slow for very large datasets. For large-scale applications, consider
using [RANN::nn2()] or [FNN::get.knnx()] for optimized k-d tree implementations.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
data  <- data.frame(x = runif(10), y = runif(10))
query <- data.frame(x = c(0.2, 0.8), y = c(0.3, 0.9))

# Return only indices of nearest neighbors
idx <- findNN(data, query)
idx

# Return both indices and distances
res <- findNN(data, query, return_dist = TRUE)
res
