\title{Generate a No-Leap Daily Date Sequence}
\usage{
noleap_date_sequence(start_date, n_days)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_date}{Date. First day of the sequence.}

\item{n_days}{Integer. Number of days to generate after `start_date`.}
}
\value{
A `Date` vector of length `n_days` with no Feb 29 included.
}
\description{
Creates a continuous sequence of dates that excludes February 29.
The sequence begins at a specified start date and continues for a
user-defined number of days. The function cycles through a
non-leap-year month-day template (Jan 1–Dec 31 without Feb 29) and
assigns appropriate year offsets.
}
\details{
The function constructs a month-day template from a non-leap year
(2001), removes Feb 29 for robustness, and then repeats this
template as needed to cover `n_days`. Year offsets are applied based
on the position in the template cycle.
